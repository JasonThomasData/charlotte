This is the initial code to make a robot with a Raspberry Pi. The robot will have four legs attached
to a central body, like half of a spider. The robot's legs will move in coordination so that
opposing digits move at once.

### Build

Type ```make``` and hope for the best. If it's a success, your executable will appear at
```bin/charlotte```. 

When you're done, clean it up with ```make clean```.

### Tests

I do like tests, and will have them, but they are to come.
